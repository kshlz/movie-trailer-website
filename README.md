Movie Trailer Website
=====================

This is project 1 for the Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree.  For this project students write 
server-side code to store a list of favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 
This is served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

### Primary Objectives
